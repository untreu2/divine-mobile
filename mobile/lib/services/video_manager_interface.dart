/// Abstract interface for video management system
///
/// This interface defines the contract for the video management system that
/// serves as the single source of truth for video state, preloading, and
/// memory management. Implementation must ensure:
///
/// ## Core Requirements
/// - Memory usage stays under 500MB regardless of video count
/// - Maximum 15 concurrent video controllers at any time
/// - Race condition prevention for controller access/disposal
/// - Circuit breaker pattern for repeatedly failing videos
/// - Efficient preloading around current viewing position
///
/// ## State Management Contract
/// - Videos maintain newest-first ordering
/// - State transitions follow VideoLoadingState enum rules
/// - Immutable video list returned to prevent external modification
/// - Null safety for non-existent videos
///
/// ## Error Handling Requirements
/// - Graceful handling of network failures, format errors, and memory pressure
/// - Progressive retry with exponential backoff
/// - Circuit breaker after max retries
/// - Detailed error reporting with video context
///
/// ## Memory Management Contract
/// - Automatic disposal of off-screen videos
/// - Preload window management (ahead/behind current position)
/// - Memory pressure handling with resource cleanup
/// - Debug information for monitoring and troubleshooting
///
/// ## Thread Safety Requirements
/// - All operations must be safe for concurrent access
/// - State transitions atomic and consistent
/// - No race conditions during controller disposal
/// - Stream-based notifications for UI updates
