## Project Notes

OpenVine pull-to-refresh architecture:

**PopularNowFeedProvider** has two ways to reload:
1. `ref.invalidate(popularNowFeedProvider)` - Rebuilds provider but doesn't force new subscription (reuses cache if parameters unchanged)
2. `ref.read(popularNowFeedProvider.notifier).refresh()` - Properly forces new subscription with `force: true` parameter

The `refresh()` method already existed and was correctly implemented - we just weren't calling it from the UI.

**Location**: mobile/lib/screens/explore_screen.dart line 736-737
