## Project Notes

**SearchScreenPure Navigation Fixes Needed**:

1. **Hashtag navigation** (line 523-541):
   - WRONG: `Navigator.push()` with HashtagScreenRouter
   - RIGHT: `context.goHashtag(hashtag)`
   - Easy fix, already have the nav extension

2. **Video navigation** (line 337-360):
   - Currently shows modal with ExploreVideoScreenPure
   - No `/search/:index` route exists in app_router
   - Options:
     a) Add search video route to app_router (cleanest, follows pattern)
     b) Navigate to explore feed (changes context, confusing)
     c) Keep modal but use computed_active_video_provider (messy)

Recommendation: Fix hashtag first (easy), then discuss with Rabble about video approach.

**Two Active Video Provider Systems**:
This is technical debt that should be consolidated eventually. The router-driven one (active_video_provider.dart) is clearly the primary system used throughout the app.
