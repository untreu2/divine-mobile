## Project Notes

## Hashtag Route Double Header Fix

**Problem**: Hashtag feed showed two identical green headers with "#comedy"

**Root Cause**:
- AppShell (ShellRoute wrapper) provides Scaffold + AppBar
- HashtagScreenRouter feed mode ALSO wrapped content in Scaffold + AppBar
- Result: Two AppBars stacked on top of each other

**Solution**:
1. Modified AppShell to show back button for hashtag/search routes
2. Removed all Scaffold wrappers from HashtagScreenRouter feed mode
3. Feed mode now returns content directly (loading/error/video player)

**Files Changed**:
- `app_shell.dart`: Added conditional back button based on route type
- `hashtag_screen_router.dart`: Removed Scaffold from loading/error/data states

**Result**: Single header with back button + #hashtag title + search/camera icons
