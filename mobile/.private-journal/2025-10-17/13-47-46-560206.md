## Project Notes

**Current Status: VideoPageView Tests Failing**

Epoch-based ownership implementation is complete and working correctly (logs show proper context switching), but test suite has infrastructure issues:

1. **Pending Timers**: All tests fail due to 30s cache timeout timer from video controller providers
2. **Wrong Provider**: Dispose lifecycle test checks deprecated `activeVideoProvider` instead of `currentPageContextProvider`

**Next Steps**:
1. Get Rabble's guidance on testing approach for provider cache timeouts
2. Update dispose lifecycle test to use correct provider
3. Fix pending timer issue based on chosen approach

**Working Features**:
- Epoch-based ownership prevents race conditions ✅
- Context switching between screens works ✅  
- didUpdateWidget handles widget reuse ✅
- Logging spam fixed ✅
