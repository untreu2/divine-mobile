## Project Notes

VideoPageView dispose pattern established:
- Capture _contextNotifier in initState: `_contextNotifier = ref.read(currentPageContextProvider.notifier)`
- Use captured notifier in dispose with postFrameCallback
- Never call ref.read() in dispose() lifecycle method

This pattern applies to any ConsumerStatefulWidget that needs to interact with providers during dispose.
