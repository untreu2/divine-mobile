## Project Notes

OpenVine Search Integration:
- SearchScreenPure already existed with full functionality (video/user/hashtag search)
- Was completely inaccessible - no route, no UI button
- Integration pattern: non-tab route like camera/settings
- Search button added to AppBar (left of camera button)
- Navigation helper: context.pushSearch()
- Route: /search

Search screen features:
- Hybrid search (local cache + remote relay via NIP-50)
- Three tabs: Videos, Users, Hashtags
- Real-time results with debouncing
- Can be embedded or standalone (embedded param)
- Already had navigation helpers for results (goProfile, goHashtag)
