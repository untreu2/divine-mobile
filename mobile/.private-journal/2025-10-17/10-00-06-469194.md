## Project Notes

**NSFW Content Handling Requirements**

User reported that Blossom servers are returning 401 errors for age-restricted content with specific authentication requirements.

**Requirements**:
1. User must confirm they are 18+ and want to see NSFW content
2. Must provide Nostr identity signed to prove adult consent
3. Need to handle 401 errors gracefully with authentication retry
4. Need persistent user preference for NSFW opt-in

**Technical Approach**:
- Use existing NIP-98 authentication infrastructure
- Modify to support GET requests (currently only supports uploads)
- Add `httpHeaders` to CachedNetworkImage calls
- Handle VideoPlayer authentication (may need different player package)
- Add user preferences for NSFW consent

**Next Steps**:
1. Design NSFW opt-in flow with age confirmation dialog
2. Extend Nip98AuthService to support GET requests
3. Create AuthenticatedMediaService for handling 401 retries
4. Implement authenticated image/video loading
5. Write comprehensive tests
