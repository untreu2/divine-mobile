## Project Notes

**URL-Driven State Pattern**:

Explore screen has two distinct modes that must be reflected in URL:
1. **Grid Mode**: Show grid of videos, no playback
   - URL: `/explore` (no videoIndex parameter)
   - State: `_isInFeedMode = false`
   - Active video: null

2. **Feed Mode**: Full-screen vertical video feed
   - URL: `/explore/{index}` (with videoIndex)
   - State: `_isInFeedMode = true, _feedStartIndex = index`
   - Active video: video at index

**Critical Rule**: State transitions MUST update URL, not just local state. Router is source of truth.

**Common Bug Pattern**: Updating local state without navigation breaks reactive video playback. Always call `context.go()` or navigation extensions when changing modes.
