## Project Notes

**Router-Driven Architecture Pattern**:

The explore feed uses a clean separation:
1. **ExploreScreen** (UI) - Handles grid display, sorting, user interaction
2. **videosForExploreRouteProvider** (data) - Provides sorted video list for active route
3. **activeVideoIdProvider** (computed) - Derives which video should play based on URL + data

This pattern ensures:
- URL is single source of truth
- Active video updates reactively when URL changes
- Sorting is consistent between display and playback
- No manual state management needed

**Critical Rule**: Any provider used by `activeVideoIdProvider` must return videos in the SAME order as displayed in UI. Otherwise index-based lookups break.
