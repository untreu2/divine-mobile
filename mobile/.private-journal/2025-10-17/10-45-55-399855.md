## Project Notes

**Video Player Stack:**
- Using `video_player_media_kit` NOT standard `video_player`
- This is a previous migration that I almost forgot about
- Media Kit backend provides superior HTTP header support for authenticated media requests
- Perfect for implementing NSFW content authentication with NIP-98
