## Project Notes

There are many other screens with AppBars that don't have explicit centerTitle settings (settings screens, camera screens, search, profile setup, etc.). These would default to platform-specific behavior (left on Android, center on iOS). Need to check with Rabble if they want all these updated too or if fixing the main navigation is sufficient.
