## Project Notes

ComposableVideoGrid consolidation FULLY COMPLETE with passing tests:

**Implementation**: lib/widgets/composable_video_grid.dart
**Tests**: test/widgets/composable_video_grid_test.dart (6/6 passing)
**Migrations**: ExploreScreen, HashtagFeedScreen, SearchScreenPure
**Deleted**: filtered_video_grid.dart, video_grid_widget.dart

Test coverage validates:
- Automatic broken video filtering via BrokenVideoTracker
- Configurable grid parameters (crossAxisCount, childAspectRatio)
- Custom empty state builders
- Video metadata display (creator, title, likes, loops, duration)
- User interaction callbacks

All real-world integrations working with automatic broken video filtering active across all screens.
