## Project Notes

## PR Creation Session (Dec 1, 2025)

Successfully created PR and pushed changes:

1. **Mobile App PR #236**: https://github.com/divinevideo/divine-mobile/pull/236
   - Video description bug fix (form values weren't being passed to publishVideoEvent)
   - Merged Derek's android camera controls (PR #234 was already merged, but we had local merge)
   - Repo was transferred from rabble/nostrvine to divinevideo/divine-mobile

2. **Embedded Relay (pushed to main)**:
   - Commit 2ef9e07: exponential backoff reconnection + verified event publishing
   - Key additions:
     - `sendEventWithVerification()` - waits for OK response with 30s timeout
     - `verifyEventExists()` - requests event back to confirm it exists
     - Exponential backoff: 2s → 5min, max 10 attempts
     - Connection callbacks for auto-flush on reconnect
   - All 11 tests pass

Key insight: The previous gh pr create failed because the repo was transferred to divinevideo org. Using `--repo rabble/nostrvine` made gh CLI redirect properly to the new location.
