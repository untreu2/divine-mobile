# 1. Go to: Admin → Channels → Mobile SDK
# 2. Click "Add mobile SDK app" if you haven't already
# 3. Copy the "Application ID" → ZENDESK_APP_ID
# 4. The clientId can be any string identifier for your app → ZENDESK_CLIENT_ID

ZENDESK_APP_ID=         # Zendesk Mobile SDK "Application ID"
ZENDESK_CLIENT_ID=      # App identifier (e.g., "divine.video" or "openvine-mobile")
