## Project Notes

Bug found: app_shell.dart was using hardcoded 'me' string when navigating to profile tab, causing "Public key must be 64 hex characters" error.

Root cause analysis reveals bigger issue: system doesn't handle nprofile format at all, only npub and hex.

Need to add comprehensive public identifier normalization:
- npub → hex
- nprofile → hex (extract pubkey, ignore relay hints)
- hex → hex (validate and pass through)

This should be a utility function used EVERYWHERE we accept public identifiers.
