## Project Notes

Added 'me' identifier support for current user profiles.

**Changes**:
- public_identifier_normalizer.dart: Added 'me' handling with currentUserHex parameter
- nav_extensions.dart: goProfile/pushProfile resolve 'me' via AuthService
- app_shell.dart: Simplified to use 'me' instead of fetching npub directly

**Result**: Code can now use `context.goProfile('me')` and it automatically resolves to current user's profile. URLs like `/profile/me` are also supported.
